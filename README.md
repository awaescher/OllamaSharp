# OllamaSharp ü¶ô

OllamaSharp provides .NET bindings for the [Ollama API](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md), simplifying interactions with Ollama both locally and remotely.

‚úÖ Supporting [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-microsoft-extensions-ai-preview/) and [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/pull/7362)

## Features

- Ease of use: Interact with Ollama in just a few lines of code.
- API endpoint coverage: Support for all the Ollama API endpoints, including chats, embeddings, listing models, pulling and creating new models, and more.
- Real-time streaming: Stream responses directly to your application.
- Progress reporting: Get real-time progress feedback on tasks like model pulling.
- Support for [vision models](https://ollama.com/blog/vision-models) and [tools (function calling)](https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support).

## Usage

OllamaSharp wraps each Ollama API endpoint in awaitable methods that fully support response streaming.

The following list shows a few simple code examples.

‚Ñπ **Try our full featured [demo application](./demo) that's included in this repository**

### Initializing

```csharp
// set up the client
var uri = new Uri("http://localhost:11434");
var ollama = new OllamaApiClient(uri);

// select a model which should be used for further operations
ollama.SelectedModel = "llama3.1:8b";
```

### Listing all models that are available locally

```csharp
var models = await ollama.ListLocalModelsAsync();
```

### Pulling a model and reporting progress

```csharp
await foreach (var status in ollama.PullModelAsync("llama3.1:405b"))
    Console.WriteLine($"{status.Percent}% {status.Status}");
```

### Generating a completion directly into the console

```csharp
await foreach (var stream in ollama.GenerateAsync("How are you today?"))
    Console.Write(stream.Response);
```

### Building interactive chats

```csharp
var chat = new Chat(ollama);
while (true)
{
    var message = Console.ReadLine();
    await foreach (var answerToken in chat.SendAsync(message))
        Console.Write(answerToken);
}
// messages including their roles and tool calls will automatically be tracked within the chat object
// and are accessible via the Messages property
```

## Usage with Microsoft.Extensions.AI

Microsoft built an abstraction library to streamline the usage of different AI providers. This is a really interesting concept if you plan to build apps that might use different providers, like ChatGPT, Claude and local models with Ollama.

I encourage you to read their accouncement [Introducing Microsoft.Extensions.AI Preview ‚Äì Unified AI Building Blocks for .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-microsoft-extensions-ai-preview/).

OllamaSharp is the first full implementation of their `IChatClient` and `IEmbeddingGenerator` that makes it possible to use Ollama just like every other chat provider.

To do this, simply use the `OllamaApiClient` as `IChatClient` instead of `IOllamaApiClient`. 

```csharp
// install package Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions

private static IChatClient CreateChatClient(Arguments arguments)
{
  if (arguments.Provider.Equals("ollama", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    return new OllamaApiClient(arguments.Uri, arguments.Model);
  else
    return new OpenAIChatClient(new OpenAI.OpenAIClient(arguments.ApiKey), arguments.Model); // ChatGPT or compatible
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `IOllamaApiClient` provides many Ollama specific methods that `IChatClient` and `IEmbeddingGenerator` miss. Because these are abstractions, `IChatClient` and `IEmbeddingGenerator` will never implement the full Ollama API specification. However, `OllamaApiClient` implements three interfaces: the native `IOllamaApiClient` and Microsoft `IChatClient` and `IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>>` which allows you to cast it to any of these two interfaces as you need them at any time.

## Observability with OpenTelemetry

> Note: The OllamaSharp OpenTelemetry integration is still in development, currently it only covers the Chat API.

OllamaSharp is instrumented with distributed tracing and metrics using .NET [tracing](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/distributed-tracing)
and [metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/metrics-instrumentation) API and supports [OpenTelemetry](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/observability-with-otel).

OllamaSharp instrumentation follows [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai).

### How to enable

The instrumentation is **experimental** - volume and semantics of the telemetry items may change.

To enable the instrumentation:

1. Set instrumentation feature-flag using one of the following options:

   - set the `OLLAMASHARP_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_OPEN_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `"true"`
   - set the `OllamaSharp.Experimental.EnableOpenTelemetry` context switch to true in your application code when application
     is starting and before initializing any OllamaSharp clients. For example:

     ```csharp
     AppContext.SetSwitch("OllamaSharp.Experimental.EnableOpenTelemetry", true);
     ```

2. Enable OllamaSharp telemetry:

   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
       .WithTracing(b =>
       {
           b.AddSource("OllamaSharp.*")
             ...
            .AddOtlpExporter();
       })
       .WithMetrics(b =>
       {
           b.AddMeter("OllamaSharp.*")
            ...
            .AddOtlpExporter();
       });
   ```

   Distributed tracing is enabled with `AddSource("OllamaSharp.*")` which tells OpenTelemetry to listen to all [ActivitySources](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.activitysource) with names starting with `OllamaSharp.*`.

   Similarly, metrics are configured with `AddMeter("OllamaSharp.*")` which enables all OllamaSharp-related [Meters](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.metrics.meter).

Consider enabling [HTTP client instrumentation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http) to see all HTTP client
calls made by your application including those done by the OllamaSharp.
Check out [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/net/getting-started/) for more details.
