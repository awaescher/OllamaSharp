# OllamaSharp ðŸ¦™

OllamaSharp is a .NET binding for the [Ollama API](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md), making it easy to interact with Ollama using your favorite .NET languages.

## Features

- Intuitive API client: Set up and interact with Ollama in just a few lines of code.
- API endpoint coverage: Support for all Ollama API endpoints including chats, embeddings, listing models, pulling and creating new models, and more.
- Real-time streaming: Stream responses directly to your application.
- Progress reporting: Get real-time progress feedback on tasks like model pulling.
- [API Console](#api-console): A ready-to-use API console to chat and manage your Ollama host remotely

## Usage

OllamaSharp wraps every Ollama API endpoint in awaitable methods that fully support response streaming.

The follow list shows a few examples to get a glimpse on how easy it is to use. The list is not complete.

### Initializing

```csharp
// set up the client
var uri = new Uri("http://localhost:11434");
var ollama = new OllamaApiClient(uri);

// select a model which should be used for further operations
ollama.SelectedModel = "llama2";
```

### Listing all models that are available locally

```csharp
var models = await ollama.ListLocalModels();
```

### Pulling a model and reporting progress

#### Callback Syntax
```csharp
await ollama.PullModel("mistral", status => Console.WriteLine($"({status.Percent}%) {status.Status}"));
```

#### IAsyncEnumerable Syntax
```csharp
await foreach (var status in ollama.PullModel("mistral"))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"({status.Percent}%) {status.Status}");
}
```

### Streaming a completion directly into the console

#### Callback Syntax
```csharp
// keep reusing the context to keep the chat topic going
ConversationContext context = null;
context = await ollama.StreamCompletion("How are you today?", context, stream => Console.Write(stream.Response));
```

#### IAsyncEnumerable Syntax
```csharp
// keep reusing the context to keep the chat topic going
ConversationContext context = null;
await foreach (var stream in ollama.StreamCompletion("How are you today?", context))
{
    Console.Write(stream.Response);
}
```


### Building interactive chats

```csharp
// uses the /chat api from Ollama 0.1.14
// messages including their roles will automatically be tracked within the chat object
var chat = ollama.Chat(stream => Console.WriteLine(stream.Message?.Content ?? ""));
while (true)
{
    var message = Console.ReadLine();
    await chat.Send(message);
}
```

## Api Console

This project ships a full-featured demo console for all endpoints the Ollama API is exposing.

This is not only a great [resource to learn](/OllamaApiConsole/Demos) about OllamaSharp, it can also be used to manage and chat with the Ollama host remotely. [Image chat](https://github.com/awaescher/OllamaSharp/blob/main/docs/imagechat.png) is supported for multi modal models.
